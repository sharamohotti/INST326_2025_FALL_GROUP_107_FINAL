## Explain of each file:
  - final_game.py: This file is our final project file that runs our game. 
  - my_scrpit.py: This file was for our final project interim derliverable. 

## How to run the program:
  To run the program in python all you need to type is
  **python final_game.py**
  then follow all the instructions from there like putting in 2 player names, 
  and inserting the correct equation cards if they match the value card. 

## How to use our program:
  1. When the program starts you will be asked to enter Player 1's and Player 2's name.
  2. After that 7 equation cards will be delt to each player at random and along with their cards being displayed each round.
  3. Then a value card will be delt each round, so each player will take turns seeing if they have an equation in thier deck that matches that value card, otherwise they will draw a card.
  6. Any matches will be dropped from the players deck and any non matches will have a new card added to their deck.
  7. When the value deck or equation deck runs out of cards they will be reshuffled and delt again. 
  8. This will continue until someone has no cards left to match.
